Greetings All !!

Yes, it is right that women's empowerment is working as a catalyst to increase the rate of divorce in India but if we go in-depth about the reason we may understand the situation.

In the early days, women were not literate and they do not allow to go outside the house. They did not have options other than their family maintenance.

So, they had to compromise whatever was the situation. This compromise was mostly from one side i.e. women's side.

Nowadays, women are becoming literate and working. Also, they are successful in each and every field as much as men. Now, they have the option to live their life in their own way. As women is empowered, they want equality in society whether it is workplace or home. Women expect compromise from men and their family side.

Sometimes in-laws are also not supportive as women expect their family with them as she grown up. At the other side, male inherit thoughts can not be changed in a day- like kitchen help and housework are not men's jobs, men's egos may be hurt by talking their wives with male colleagues or by their wife's success. These thoughts are not in the control of men that should be understood by women. How a hundred of years thought can change in some decade of years. The evolution of thoughts will take time.

Everyone wants freedom and to live happily and peacefully. So, she starts to compare worsened married life with what can she make life with her ability. Now she has one more option of self-dependent. She can earn herself, she can take care of herself and she can live as she wants. So she has to choose divorce. She does not compromise as her mother or grandmother did.

In this situation, both persons should understand the situation, try to mould themselves according to the partner's wish if it is ethically right. They should respect each other's opinions. After keeping their personal ego aside, they should think about how can they change for each other. They should understand how can a person who has been living in a different environment for 25-30 years, change suddenly for you. If compromise will not happen from both sides, divorce will happen.

Usually, women respect those men who treat them equally. Women also need to understand that their short-time efforts, love and respect can save their longtime married life. If both will treat each other equally with respect, only married life can run. Divorce happens due to clashes of two different thoughts i.e. women's empowerment and inherit thoughts of men.
